I was introduced to RPG Maker XP ("RMXP" for short) ten years ago when some
friends and I thought it would be fun to make a 16-bit-era JRPG. Our year's
worth of efforts helped me make many meaningful and lasting friendships and
sparked in me an ongoing interest in game design. I carry that interest with me
today and it continues to influence the way I approach creative endeavors like
my recent thesis work. 

It's a little strange to say, but RMXP and the community surrounding it have
made a profound impact on me. This musical theme is thus a tribute. It is an
expansion/variation on one of the prepackaged MIDI background music files that
shipped with the engine, 035-Dungeon01.mid
